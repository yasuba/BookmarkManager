#Bookmark Manager

The goal of this project was to put into practice the technologies I had learned so far by week 6 of Makers Academy. We were tasked to create a web app that can store a user's bookmarked websites in the style of delicious.com or pineapple.io.

The bookmark manager is able to:

* Show a list of links from the database
* Add new links
* Add tags to the links
* Filter links by a tag
* Allow users to sign up for accounts, the sign out and in

##Technologies

* Ruby
* PostgreSQL
* DataMapper
* Sinatra
* Capybara
* RSpec
